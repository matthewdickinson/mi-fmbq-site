## Why quiz?

Bible Quizzing is a valuable ministry of the modern church -- helping it fulfill the Church's mission to its youth. The ministry can aid youth in a variety of ways!


**Getting to know Jesus:**
- Intellectually
  - Study what Jesus said about himself
  - Study what the Apostles (his friends and co-workers) had learned from him
- Personally
  - Study, practice, and quizmeets all give quizzers opportunities to really wrestle with the Bible and understand the one who authored it
  - Coaches, quizmasters, and spectators are all available to discuss what Jesus has done in their lives
- Even when people turn away from the church, they will still have these words hidden away -- words that the Holy Spirit can and does use to prompt them

Learn to serve:
- Over the years, national FMBQ has hosted a number of foreign missions trips for quizzers. This gives quizzers an opportunity to serve and to meet those outside their culture
- The Waypoint quizmeet always includes a service opportunity as part of the day

Gain academic benefit:
- Quizzing encourages a regular disciple of study
- Encourages getting to know your own learning style
- Helps improve language skills
  - Quizzing has involved people who have English as a second language and gives them an opportunity to really perfect those skills
- Quizzing encourages the valuable skill of memorization. This is an invaluable skill to have in school, college, and future jobs!

Get the advantages of a sport:
- Encourages learning good sportsmanship in competition
- Make friends with the other quizzers
  - Past quizzers can tell you of the life-long friends they have made, not just with members of their own church, but with other quizzers from around the country

## But, like really, what is quizzing like?

Right now we don't have very up-to-date resources demonstrating quizzing, but these two videos from the early 2000s do still give a reasonable sense of the program.
