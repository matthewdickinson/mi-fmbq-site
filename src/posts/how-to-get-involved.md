## Getting involved!

The first question about quizzing that many people have is: "what does getting involved look like?"

### As a adult

 - First and foremost, adults can pray and encourage the children and teens that they know, go to church with, and/or are we related to to quiz. Sometimes, it's hard to teens to take that first step of giving it a try and an adult encouraging them is what it takes. 
 - Secondly, adults can help start a team at their church. While this can sound intimidating, most teams are started by coaches who don't have previous experience. We have materials to help you get started: donors who will buy your first year of practice material (scripture portions and practice questions) and the ministry has quiz seats that they will lend to first-year teams for no charge.
 - Thirdly, the monthly tournaments need various support people: quizmasters, extra coaches, spectators, etc..
 - QUIZ! Even as an adult, you can also learn the material. This is encouraging to the quizzers and gives you an opportunity to participate in one of the rounds at the monthly tournament. At Nationals, there is also an adult division that quizzes in the evening to let adults have the full experience and/or re-live the glory days!

### As a teen
If you're interested, encourage your friends and classmates to quiz with you. Having a team that you can interact with at your local level is the ideal scenario.

**However**, if you're unable to find teammates, this year, we're trying a "conference" team. This team is like an "incubator" for quizzers who can't find local quizzers to join their team. We'll pair you up with a coach and other individuals from around the state, do practices online, and meet up at the monthly quizzes. This will give you consistent team that you can get to know and practice with throughout the year. If, after having a quiz or two under your belt, you're able to convince local friends to join a team, we'll work with your to set up a team at your own church/school/whatever.
