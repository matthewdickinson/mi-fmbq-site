## New Levels

New to the 2025-2026 season, Michigan is moving from an structure with 3 age-based tiers to a structure with two tiers based on amount of material.

- **Standard** - This level includes the full set of Material (Acts 1-14, Galatians, Colossians, and Philemon), is open to quizzers from 6<sup>th</sup> - 12<sup>th</sup> grade. This is the same material and ages that qualify for participation at Nationals.
- **Casual** - This is a new level that is targeted at younger quizzers (4<sup>th</sup> - 5<sup>th</sup> grade) and those that are less competitive, unable to dedicate the time to study the large set of material, etc.. All the rules are the same, but the material is approximately one third of Standard (Acts 1-9).


## Why?

For less experienced quizzers, it's pretty easy to fall behind on the material in Standard. This has lead many quizzers to dropping out as the year goes on and has lead to many potential quizzers never joining because the amount of material is intimidating. We don't want this to stand in the way of youth getting to know God's Word or experiencing the fellowship that comes with Bible Quizzing. We also want to enable younger quizzers to get into the program with a less overwhelming workload.

## Can I move between the tiers?

Yes! The first month, everyone will be doing Acts chapter 1 (but Standard will also be doing chapters 2, 3, and 4). We encourage everyone to try Standard -- the team that defines the material list is very dedicated and strives to make sure that the Ministry selects an achievable list of material. However, if you're just getting started or your team finds that this amount of material is more than you can commit to, you're welcome to switch to Casual at any point throughout the year.

On the other hand, if you start in Casual and find that you're doing really well and are ready for another challenge, you can always move up to Standard. Each month, the questions are primarily (~70%) from that month's material, so you if you moved up a tier, you wouldn't immediately need to go back and learn the material that you had missed. You could just focus on the new material and backfill the rest over future months.

Currently, there is no real Casual division at Nationals, but, even if you competed in Casual all year, you can still register for Nationals and we'd be happy to help you make a plan for catching up on the remaining material. 

We hope that this change allows us to invite more people in to experience the benefits of quizzing!
