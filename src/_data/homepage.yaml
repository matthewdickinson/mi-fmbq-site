  ## What is Bible Quizzing?


  Bible Quizzing is a game that is also a network of relationships, connecting teens from across church, state and even international lines, all centered on studying one chapter at a time through the text, testing their skills of quick recall, besides living and loving and growing as they apply these words to their lives. 


  What are we studying?  **Romans and James** is our text this year, three chapters per month.  Material does not need to be memorized, but the aim is to learn the content well enough to answer questions about it. This allows quizzers to operate without being penalized by having a different interpretive or theological background than someone else, but also giving them a solid background and foundation in the text itself.


  Quiz rounds follow a vaguely quiz bowl format


  * Each round has 15 questions

  * Quizzers quiz in teams of 2 or 3 and buzz in for a chance to answer

  * Points are awarded to the first team that correctly answers the question.

  * Questions are limited to factual questions; specific theological interpretations are not required.


  Tournaments are generally held the second Saturday of each month from October - April. There are optional regional and national tournaments that take place in May and July.


  > For the Word of God is alive and active.  Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.  *Hebrews 4:12*

  > Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. *Matthew 24:35*
