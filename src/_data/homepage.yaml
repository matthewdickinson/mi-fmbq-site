title: FMBQ
body: >-
  Bible Quizzing is a game that is also a network of relationships, connecting teens from across church, state and even international lines, all centered on studying one chapter at a time through the text, testing their skills of quick recall -- living and loving and growing as they apply these words to their lives. 

  ### Who are we?

  Quizzing is open to anyone from 4th to 12th grade -- no demoninational (or even church) affiliation required. FMBQ is a ministry of the [Free Methodist Church](https://fmcusa.org/) and operates under its principals, specifically [regarding our view of scripture](https://fmcusa.org/webelieve)

  > The Bible is God’s written Word, uniquely inspired by the Holy Spirit. It bears unerring witness to Jesus Christ, the living Word. [...] it is the trustworthy record of God’s revelation, completely truthful in all it affirms. It has been faithfully preserved and proves itself true in human experience.

  >

  > The Bible has authority over all human life. It teaches the truth about God, His creation, His people, His one and only Son and the destiny of humankind. It also teaches the way of salvation and the life of faith.

  ### What are we studying?

  This year, we are offering [two track with slightly different material](https://mi.fmquizzing.net/posts/quizzing-levels/):
   - Standard will be quizzing over Acts 1 - 14, Galations, Colossians, and Philemon.
   - Casual will be quizzing over Acts 1 - 11.
   
   Material does not need to be memorized, but the aim is to learn the content well enough to answer questions about it. This allows quizzers to operate without being penalized by having a different interpretive or theological background than someone else, but also giving them a solid background and foundation in the text itself.


  ### How?

  Quiz rounds follow a basic quiz bowl format


  * Each round has 15 questions

  * Quizzers quiz in teams of 2 or 3 and buzz in for a chance to answer (teams can contain up to 5 quizzers, but a maximum of 3 can quiz at a time)

  * Points are awarded to the first team that correctly answers the question.

  * Questions are limited to factual questions; specific theological interpretations are not required. For example, questions could be things like:
    *  "John baptized with **what**?" ("Water")
    *  "Two part question: John baptized with **what**, _but_ in a few days, with **what** will you be baptized?" ("Water; the Holy Spirit.")


  ### When?

  Tournaments are generally held the second Saturday of each month from October - April. There are optional regional and national tournaments that take place in May and July.


  > For the Word of God is alive and active.  Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.  *Hebrews 4:12*

  > Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. *Matthew 24:35*
